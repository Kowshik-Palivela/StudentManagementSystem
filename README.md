# StudentManagementSystem
This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application for managing student records. It allows you to perform basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data, which includes a unique ID, name, and marks.

The system is built in Java and uses an `ArrayList` to store the student objects in memory.

## Features

-   **Add Student:** Create a new student record by entering their name and marks. The system automatically assigns a unique ID.
-   **View Students:** Display a list of all student records currently stored in the system.
-   **Update Student:** Modify the name or marks of an existing student by providing their ID.
-   **Delete Student:** Remove a student's record from the system using their unique ID.
